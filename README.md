# Feed Reader Testing
This is a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. Tt is required for my _front end development course_ by **Udacity**. 

## How to Run The application?
1. Download the following zip file:
   * **Project4**    
2. Click on index.html within the the zipped file 


## what will you see?
* When the page is loaded, you can find a grey section titled in purple **Jasmine**
* It has 7 dots underneath which are the number of our tests or what we call "Specs"
* Specs indicate our tests that are working correctly 
* If our tests fail we'll have a failure that helps the developer find the error promptly
